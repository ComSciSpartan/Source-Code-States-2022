"""
Simple Function
Make the function return True.
"""
def question1():
    pass


"""
Fibonacci Numbers
Calculate the first 20 Fibonacci numbers and put them in a list. Simply adding the first 20 to a
list will result in no points. You must use a for loop in order to receive credit. 
"""
def question2():
    pass


"""
Converting Types
A list of numbers "data" will be passed in. Convert the list of strings to a list of integers and 
return it. You must perform a conversion on each list item to receive points. 
"""
def question3(data):
    pass


"""
Calculations
Two points will be passed into this function. Use the distance formula to calculate the distance
between the two points and return it. The math library is already imported for you. 
"""
def question4(x1, y1, x2, y2):
    pass


"""
Prime Numbers
A random number "data" will be passed in. Create an algorithm to check if the number is prime.
Return True if it is prime and False otherwise. Hard coding the inputs to return a certain value
will result in no points. Ex: if(input == 2) return True, is not allowed.
"""
def question4(data):
    pass


"""
Build a Dictionary
Create a dictionary from the passed in list "data" and return it. The dictionary key is the value's
index in the list and the dictionary value is the list element at that index. Ex the list
[red, green, blue] is passed in. The resulting dictionary would be {'0' : 'red', '1' : 'green', 
'2' : 'blue'}
